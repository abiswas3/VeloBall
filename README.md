This project uses the pcs-scraper binary (part of the velo-scraper package) to politely scrape professional cycling statistics for the Tour de France, Vuelta a España, and Giro d’Italia. The data is used solely for Velogames analysis and community purposes. I do not profit from any of the data or this project. If ProCyclingStats has any issue with this scraper, I will take it down immediately. The code is open source and licensed under the MIT License, as detailed in the LICENSE.txt file.
